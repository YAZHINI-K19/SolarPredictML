# 🌞 SolarPredictML

**SolarPredictML** is a machine learning project focused on predicting solar panel requirements and estimating energy savings based on energy usage data. This repository includes training scripts, serialized ML models, and a Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Predicts the number of solar panels required based on user energy consumption.
- Estimates potential energy and cost savings from switching to solar.
- Provides reusable `.pkl` model files for direct integration.
- Includes a notebook to explore and understand the dataset.
