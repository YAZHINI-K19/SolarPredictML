# 🌞 SolarPredictML

**SolarPredictML** is a machine learning project for predicting solar panel requirements and estimating energy savings based on user consumption data. It features modular training and prediction scripts, pre-trained models, curated datasets, and a data exploration notebook.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `ml_scripts/` – Model training and prediction scripts  
- `models/` – Trained `.pkl` model files  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebook for exploratory analysis  
- `data/`  
  - `solar_data/` – Dataset for solar panel prediction  
  - `savings_data/` – Dataset for energy savings estimation  

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## 🚀 Usage

* Train savings model: `python ml_scripts/energy_savings_ml.py`
* Predict savings: `python ml_scripts/predict_savings.py`
* Predict solar panels: `python ml_scripts/solar_predict.py`
* Explore data: `jupyter notebook notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb`
