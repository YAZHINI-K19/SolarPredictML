# 🌞 SolarPredictML

**SolarPredictML** is a machine learning project for predicting solar panel requirements and estimating energy savings from solar adoption. It includes clean, modular scripts for training and prediction, pre-trained models, and a data exploration notebook.

## 📦 Contents
- `ml_scripts/` – Model training and prediction scripts  
- `models/` – Serialized `.pkl` model files  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebook for exploratory analysis  

## ⚙️ Setup
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## 🚀 Quick Start

* Train model: `python ml_scripts/energy_savings_ml.py`
* Predict savings: `python ml_scripts/predict_savings.py`
* Predict solar panels: `python ml_scripts/solar_predict.py`
